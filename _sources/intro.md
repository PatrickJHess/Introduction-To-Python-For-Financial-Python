# Background Material: An Introduction to Python for Financial Python

There are twelve notebooks in the Jupyter book each relating to topic used in ***Financial Python***.  Many of our readers may have little or no exposure to Python.  These twelve notebooks are a **practical primer** designed to support readers of Financial Python, especially those who might be new to programming. The main goal is to provide **just-in-time** help with Python, NumPy, Pandas, and other topics so that users can focus on the core financial material without getting tripped up by the syntax. They're a resource to be used on an **as-needed basis**.

**Interacting with Jupyter Notebooks**

Notebook Launch Options

The launch icon provides three interactive options for notebook documents:

| Option | Description | Interactive Features | Note |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Binder** | Launches in a new browser tab (typically within a minute) and runs remotely. Supports up to 100 simultaneous users. | Execute existing cells, add or modify cells, and download the notebook. | The notebook will not be saved or available if saved in this mode. |
| **Colab** | Offers the quickest and easiest access, not requiring Binder. A Google Drive is unnecessary for launching. | Execute cells or make a copy. | You must sign in to a Google account to execute cells or make a copy. You can download the notebook without signing into a Google account. |
| **Live Code** | Requires a Binder launch and is ideal for demonstrations. | Run code in existing cells, and alter code in existing cells. | You cannot add cells or save results in this mode. |

Additional Interactive Features

* **Copying Code:** Any code cell or code block can be copied to the clipboard by moving the cursor to its upper-right corner.
