# Background Material: An Introduction to Python for Financial Python

There are twelve notebooks in the Jupyter book each relating to topic used in ***Financial Python***.  Many of our readers may have little or no exposure to Python.  These twelve notebooks are a **practical primer** designed to support readers of Financial Python, especially those who might be new to programming. The main goal is to provide **just-in-time** help with Python, NumPy, Pandas, and other topics so that users can focus on the core financial material without getting tripped up by the syntax. They're a resource to be used on an **as-needed basis**.

Beyond simply viewing the notebooks, there are several ways to interact with them:

*  ***Download:*** Each notebook can be downloaded individually.

*  ***Copy Code Cells:*** Code cells can be copied by hovering the cursor over the upper-right corner.
*  ***Launch Options:*** Clicking the launch icon provides three choices:

   *    **Binder:** Opens the notebook in a new browser tab. Binder launches in under a minute. The current version of Binder used by Financial Python has a limit of 100 simultaneous users.
   *    **Colab:** This option launches a Colab version of the notebook, bypassing the need for Binder.
   *    **Live Code:** This option allows users to run any code cell directly within the notebook after it launches (Binder must launch).
