# Background Material: An Introduction to Python for Financial Python

There are twelve notebooks in the Jupyter book each relating to topic used in ***Financial Python***.  Many of our readers may have little or no exposure to Python.  These twelve notebooks are a **practical primer** designed to support readers of Financial Python, especially those who might be new to programming. The main goal is to provide **just-in-time** help with Python, NumPy, Pandas, and other topics so that users can focus on the core financial material without getting tripped up by the syntax. They're a resource to be used on an **as-needed basis**.
