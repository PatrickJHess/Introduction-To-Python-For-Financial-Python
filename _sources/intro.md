# Background Material: An Introduction to Python for Financial Python

There are twelve notebooks in the Jupyter book each relating to topic used in ***Financial Python***.  Many of our readers may have little or no exposure to Python.  These twelve notebooks are a **practical primer** designed to support readers of Financial Python, especially those who might be new to programming. The main goal is to provide **just-in-time** help with Python, NumPy, Pandas, and other topics so that users can focus on the core financial material without getting tripped up by the syntax. They're a resource to be used on an **as-needed basis**.

**Interacting with Jupyter Notebooks**

The Jupyter notebooks can be viewed just as you are viewing this page; however, they offer deeper interactive capabilities.  For example the upper-right corner of *Basic Grammar* shows icons for launching and downloading the notebook.  Downloading needs no elaboration.  The launch icon offers three options:

* **Binder:**
    * Launches in a new browser tab, typically within a minute. 
    * Supports up to one hundred simultaneous users.
    * Functions like any other Jupyter notebook, but runs remotely.
    * Allows you to:
        * Execute existing cells.
        * Add or modify cells.
        * Download the notebook.
    * Note: In this mode the notebook will not be available if saved. 

* **Colab:**
    * Offers the quickest and easiest access without requiring Binder.
        * A Google Drive is not necessary for launching.
        * You can download the notebook without signing into a Google account.
    * Note: You must sign in to a Google account to execute cells or make a copy.
      

* **Live Code:**
    * Requires a Binder launch and is ideal for demonstrations.
    * Enables you to:
        * Run code in existing cells.
        * Alter code in existing cells.
    * Note: You cannot add cells or save results in this mode.

**Any code cell in a notebook or code block in a text cell can be copied to the clipboard by moving your cursor to upper-right corner of the code cell or code block.**
